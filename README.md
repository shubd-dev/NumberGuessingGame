# ðŸŽ‰ Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a fun and interactive game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it within a limited number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `Main` class to begin the game.
2. **Select Difficulty**: Choose one of the following difficulty levels:
   - Easy: 10 chances
   - Medium: 5 chances
   - Hard: 3 chances
3. **Guess the Number**: Enter your guesses to find the correct number. The game will guide you by indicating if your guess is higher or lower than the chosen number.
4. **Win or Lose**: If you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose and can try again.

## ðŸ’» Code Structure

- **Main.java**: Contains the main logic for the game, including setting the difficulty level and processing the user's guesses.
- **NumberGuessingGame.java**: The class that handles the game logic and user interaction.

## ðŸ§ª Tests

We have created test cases using JUnit to ensure the correctness of the game logic. The test file is located in the `src/test/java` directory.
